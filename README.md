# HealthCarePoint

HealthCarePoint is a TypeScript-based web application, designed with React, that focuses on delivering healthcare services online. The application includes key features such as an appointment booking system with unique case numbers and email notifications, multi-language support powered by a LanguageContext, and a responsive design created using styled-components and framer-motion for dynamic animations.

The platform is structured into pages such as the Home Page, Booking Page, About Page, Services Page, and Contact Page, each offering specialized functionality. For example, the Booking Page allows users to schedule appointments, while the Contact Page shares essential contact information, working hours, and location details. Static files and assets, along with react-router-driven navigation, ensure a seamless user experience.

With its modular structure, modern design principles, and adaptability, the “HealthCarePoint” project is geared toward making healthcare services more accessible and user-friendly for diverse audiences.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
